# Portfolio_Projects
Portfolio projects for interested parties 

Hi, I'm Ryan Shanahan, an entry-level data analyst, and the purpose of this github repo is to be a one stop shop for all of my outside of work projects.
Here you can find mainly jupyter notebooks and sql queries I've wrttien in the past to perform EDA, webscraping, and other tasks that are core to the data analytics experience.
I'm always updating old projects and adding new ones to this repo so feel free to revisit in the future to see the updates!
